# Huawei Cloud Adoption Skills

This repository defines a practical skill framework for Huawei Cloud adoption work. It is designed to help AI coding agents, delivery engineers, architects, and solution teams reuse Huawei Cloud best practices through scenario-based skill packages.

An AI skill in this repository is not just a prompt. It is a reusable capability unit built around a cloud scenario, where AI helps with understanding, design, migration, operations, development, analysis, or optimization.

Recent updates added the codex-huawei-maas skill (side-by-side `codex-glm` command that routes Codex CLI to Huawei MaaS through an isolated CCR `/v1/responses` shim), the LiteLLM Huawei MaaS Proxy skill, the Huawei Cloud SEC EDGAR big-data monitoring PoC skill, and the Huawei ECS HTTP proxy SSH skill, while also refreshing the Claude Code Huawei MaaS workflow and consolidating the former single-ECS SearXNG gateway (self-hosted search MCP + claude-glm client) into the LiteLLM Huawei MaaS Proxy skill as an optional `search` profile.

Each skill should include:

- Scenario: what business problem or cloud scenario it addresses
- Knowledge: what cloud products, architecture, and domain logic are required
- Tools: what AI models, APIs, scripts, platforms, or workflows are used
- Method: how AI is embedded into the delivery process
- Output and validation: what is produced and how the result is verified

## Agent Skill Index

Use this index when Codex, Claude Code, or another AI agent needs to locate the right reusable skill quickly. Start from the business scenario, then open the linked skill folder. The child skill `README.md` gives the repository-facing summary, while `SKILL.md` contains the agent-facing workflow and trigger rules when present.

For the latest additions, check the `AI / AI-Coding`, `Big Data`, and `Cloud Foundation` entries near the end of the index, including the codex-huawei-maas, LiteLLM Huawei MaaS Proxy, SEC EDGAR monitoring, and HTTP proxy SSH skills.

## How To Navigate This Repository

1. Identify the business scenario, not the model technique.
2. Choose the Level 1 domain: Cloud Foundation, Application Modernization, Big Data, or AI.
3. Choose the Level 2 use case folder that matches the delivery scenario.
4. Open the child skill folder when a concrete reusable package exists.
5. Read `README.md` for the human-readable overview and `SKILL.md` for the agent-facing workflow.
6. Use bundled `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, or `examples/` only when the skill package provides them.

## Agent Runtime Support

The skill packages are written so they can be used by multiple AI coding agents.

- **Codex**: use `SKILL.md` as the agent-facing workflow, then load `references/` or run bundled scripts only when needed.
- **Claude Code**: use the same `SKILL.md` and reusable assets as task context. For Huawei Cloud MaaS-backed Claude Code setup, start from the Claude Code SDK Agent MaaS skill or the Claude Code Huawei MaaS router skill in the AI Coding domain.
- **Other coding agents**: use the repository index to locate the scenario package, then treat `README.md` or `Readme.md` as the human overview and `SKILL.md` as the operational instruction set.

## Level 1 Domains

The repository follows the `1+3` Huawei Cloud adoption domain structure:

- [Cloud Foundation](./Cloud-Foundation/README.md): baseline cloud governance, landing zones, networking, resilience, security, and operations.
- [Application Modernization](./Application-Modernization/README.md): migration, refactoring, platform modernization, DevOps, workspace, and database modernization.
- [Big Data](./Big-Data/README.md): data warehouse migration, big data platform transformation, governance, analytics, and AI knowledge base foundations.
- [AI](./AI/README.md): model consumption, AI infrastructure, development productivity, agent platforms, data engineering, governance, and AI applications.

## Level 2 Use Cases

Each Level 1 domain contains Level 2 use case directories. This layer groups skills by delivery scenarios such as landing zones, migration, data governance, agent platforms, AI coding, or AI knowledge base foundations.

Use the Level 2 folders as stable places to add future child skill packages. A child skill package should usually contain a short `README.md`, an optional `SKILL.md`, and reusable assets such as references, scripts, templates, or examples.

## Design Principles

This framework follows five principles:

1. Start from cloud scenarios, then map AI capabilities.
2. Every skill must connect to a real use case.
3. Every skill must become a reusable asset.
4. Every skill must have a maturity level.
5. Every skill must be measurable against business outcomes.

The goal is to organize skills by business value, cloud scenario, and delivery action instead of organizing them only by model techniques such as prompting, RAG, agents, or fine-tuning.

## General Skills

General Skills are the common foundation required across all Huawei Cloud adoption work. They are not limited to one cloud service, one project type, or one delivery team.

### G1. Scenario Understanding and Requirement Abstraction

Translate customer requirements into a structured view of the current system, process pain points, possible AI intervention points, and the expected pull on cloud resource consumption.

### G2. AI Interaction and Prompt Design

Use AI effectively through structured questioning, output control, multi-turn clarification, role setting, constraint injection, and result verification.

### G3. Cloud Knowledge Retrieval and Knowledge Injection

Improve AI usefulness by connecting it with product documents, architecture knowledge, solution materials, FAQs, SOPs, and project experience through retrieval and knowledge update mechanisms.

### G4. API / SDK / CLI / IaC Automation

Move beyond answers into actions by using APIs, SDKs, CLI tools, Terraform, IaC patterns, and AI-assisted script generation and correction.

### G5. Security and Governance

Keep skill execution safe and controllable through identity and permission management, sensitive data protection, auditability, output control, model usage boundaries, and compliance awareness.

### G6. Observability, Evaluation, and Optimization

Measure and improve skills through accuracy, success rate, latency, cost, token consumption, task completion rate, and human replacement efficiency.

### G7. Integration and Workflow Orchestration

Embed AI into delivery workflows by connecting it with IDEs, DevOps pipelines, ticketing systems, monitoring systems, data platforms, and agent or workflow orchestration patterns.

### G8. Assetization and Replication

Turn every skill into repeatable assets such as Skill Cards, demo scripts, SOPs, training content, PoC templates, and replication templates.

## Skill Levels

Each skill should have a clear maturity level:

- Level 1. Understand: explain the scenario, required knowledge, and expected outputs
- Level 2. Execute: apply the skill in a real delivery task with repeatable steps
- Level 3. Replicate: package the skill into reusable assets that can be copied across projects

The level should reflect delivery capability, not just awareness or training attendance.

## Required Skill Assets

Each skill should eventually be documented and packaged into reusable outputs:

- Solution material
- Demo
- Scripts
- Best practices
- Test report
- FAQ and troubleshooting
- Reusable template

## Business Value Alignment

The framework is intended to support:

- Top project breakthrough
- PoC success
- Commercial replication
- Revenue growth
- Asset accumulation

This repository starts with a general framework and grows through domain-specific, use-case-specific Huawei Cloud Adoption Skills.
